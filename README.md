# EtherPad-Collaboration-Analizer
This repository is meant for software made to add on to the code realized for the experiments in the
paper "Spacetime Characterization of Real-Time Collaborative Editing" (Gabriele D'Angelo, Angelo Di Iorio, Stefano~Zacchiroli).

For now, it only consists in a python 3 script that analizes a pad file and extracts a data structure which represents the space and time distance of an edit from another one.
